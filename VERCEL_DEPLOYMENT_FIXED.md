# üöÄ Vercel Deployment - Fixed Configuration

## What Was Fixed

### Issue
The initial deployment was showing a Vercel login page because the application wasn't properly configured for Vercel's serverless architecture.

### Solution
Added proper Vercel configuration to deploy the full-stack application (React frontend + Express backend API).

---

## Files Added/Modified

### 1. `vercel.json` (NEW)
Configuration file that tells Vercel:
- How to build the project
- How to route requests
- Where the API endpoints are

### 2. `api/index.ts` (NEW)
Serverless function that handles `/api/contact` endpoint:
- Validates form submissions
- Stores submissions
- Sends emails via SMTP
- Works in Vercel's serverless environment

### 3. `package.json` (MODIFIED)
Added `@vercel/node` dependency for TypeScript serverless functions.

---

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Vercel configuration for full-stack deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Redeploy on Vercel
Vercel will automatically detect the changes and redeploy. If not:
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment

### 3. Verify Environment Variables
Make sure these are still set in Vercel:
- `SMTP_HOST` = smtp.gmail.com
- `SMTP_PORT` = 587
- `SMTP_USER` = gilbertodongo02@gmail.com
- `SMTP_PASS` = xtxdofqgypoujtgt
- `CONTACT_EMAIL` = gilbertodongo02@gmail.com
- `NODE_ENV` = production

---

## How It Works

### Frontend (React/Vite)
- Built to `dist/public/`
- Served as static files
- All routes handled by React Router (Wouter)

### Backend (API)
- Serverless function at `/api/index.ts`
- Handles `/api/contact` endpoint
- Automatically scales with Vercel

### Routing
```
/ ‚Üí dist/public/index.html (React app)
/about ‚Üí dist/public/index.html (React handles routing)
/api/contact ‚Üí api/index.ts (Serverless function)
```

## Testing After Deployment

### 1. Visit Your Site
```
https://your-project.vercel.app
```

### 2. Test All Sections
- ‚úÖ Hero section loads
- ‚úÖ About section displays
- ‚úÖ Services carousel works
- ‚úÖ Gallery images load
- ‚úÖ Team members visible
- ‚úÖ Contact form is accessible

### 3. Test Contact Form
1. Fill out the "Contact Us" form
2. Submit the form
3. Check for success message
4. Check gilbertodongo02@gmail.com for the email

### 4. Test Quote Request
1. Switch to "Request a Quote" tab
2. Fill out cargo details
3. Submit the form
4. Verify email delivery

## Troubleshooting

### ‚ùå Build Fails
**Check:**
- All dependencies are in `package.json`
- Environment variables are set
- Build logs in Vercel dashboard

### ‚ùå API Not Working
**Check:**
- Environment variables (especially SMTP_PASS)
- Function logs in Vercel dashboard
- CORS headers in `api/index.ts`

### ‚ùå 404 Errors
**Check:**
- `vercel.json` routing configuration
- Build output directory is correct
- Static files are in `dist/public/`

### ‚ùå Email Not Sending
**Check:**
- SMTP credentials in Vercel environment variables
- Gmail App Password is still valid
- Check function logs for email errors

---

## Important Notes

1. **Serverless Functions** - The API runs as a serverless function, not a long-running server
2. **Cold Starts** - First API request after inactivity may be slower
3. **In-Memory Storage** - Contact submissions are logged but not persisted (emails are sent)
4. **Auto-Scaling** - Vercel automatically scales your application

---

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Commit and push changes
2. ‚úÖ Wait for Vercel auto-deployment
3. ‚úÖ Test the deployed site
4. ‚úÖ Set up custom domain (see VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)
5. ‚úÖ Monitor function logs in Vercel dashboard
