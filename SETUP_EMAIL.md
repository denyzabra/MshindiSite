## üìù Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Enable 2-Step Verification on Gmail

1. Go to [Google Account Security Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
2. Find "2-Step Verification" 
3. Click "Get Started" and follow the prompts
4. Complete the setup (you'll need your phone)

### Step 2: Generate Gmail App Password

1. After enabling 2-Step Verification, go back to [Security Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
2. Scroll down to "2-Step Verification"
3. At the bottom, find "App passwords"
4. Click on "App passwords"
5. Select:
   - **App:** Mail
   - **Device:** Other (Custom name) ‚Üí Enter "Mshindi Website"
6. Click "Generate"
7. **Copy the 16-character password** (format: xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Save this somewhere - you won't see it again!

### Step 3: Create .env File

1. In your project root directory, create a file named `.env`
2. Add the following environment variables:

   ```env
   SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   SMTP_PORT=587
   SMTP_USER=gilbertodongo02@gmail.com
   SMTP_PASS=your-16-character-app-password-here
   CONTACT_EMAIL=gilbertodongo02@gmail.com
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

3. Replace `your-16-character-app-password-here` with the actual password from Step 2
4. Save the file

**Note:** The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore` and will not be committed to version control.

### Step 4: Restart the Application

1. Stop the current development server (Ctrl+C)
2. Run `npm run dev` to restart
3. Check the logs - you should see: `[express] serving on port 5000`

## üîç Troubleshooting

### "Email configuration not set" in console
- Make sure the .env file exists in the project root
- Check that SMTP_USER and SMTP_PASS are correctly set in .env
- Verify there are no spaces or quotes around the values
- Restart the development server after creating/updating .env

### Emails not arriving
- Check spam/junk folder in Gmail
- Verify the App Password is correct (no spaces)
- Make sure 2-Step Verification is still enabled
- Try generating a new App Password

### "Invalid credentials" error
- The App Password might be wrong
- Generate a new App Password and update SMTP_PASS in .env
- Make sure you're using App Password, NOT your regular Gmail password
